# Bio: 
Jean Eckelberg is a hard worker fueled by her raging passion and unwavering determination. Jean works to create a world where people can express and share their ideas without fear of retaliation. She does this by creating narratives that challenge those who consume her content to open their minds to other perspectives and explore the duality in human nature. Her end goal is to create engaging content that helps people see the world from beyond their own personal experiences.
Jean excels in programming, storytelling, video editing, audio mixing, audio mastering, sound design, team management, and overcoming obstacles. She started programming in grade 5 and was creating stories since she was born. As a transwoman, she has experienced adversity and broadened her perspective of the world. As a person diagnosed with ADHD, she has learned to utilize it in such a way that allows her to multitask and see potential problems before others. As someone who was bullied as a child, she learned empathy and compassion for those who face discrimination. Lastly, as someone who lived abroad, she experienced different cultures and incorporated them into herself, broadening her horizons further and making her an effective communicator. Jean has turned her challenging past into learning experiences and propelled herself forward with her optimism and grit.
	Every life has a story and has a value that is no greater or less than any other life. Jean works toward a world where that belief is not only shared by everyone but practiced as well.
